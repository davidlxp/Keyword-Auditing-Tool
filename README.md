# Keyword-Auditing-Tool
Using Web-Crawler to automatically determine the keyword's relevancy with brands or specific products

If you have a brand (eg. github) and a list of domain_keywords (eg. githib.com, guthub.net, guttthub.code, getup.com) which are the typo of that brand, and if you want to determine whether the keywords are relevent enough to that brand, what will you do? I assume by manual, you will search the keywords on a Major search engine, and determine the relevancy based on the information on the search landing page.

In this project, our goal is to automate this manual task by building a web-crawler that can automatically achieve the keywords' information from the search landing page. And using a series of methods to determine their relevancy to the brand assigned.

The project can also be used to check keywords's (eg. bestshoes.com, cheapshoes.net) relevancy to a specific product (eg. shoe).
